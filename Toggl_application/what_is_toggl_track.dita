            <b>Toggl Track</b> is a time tracking application with a timer that helps you work in
            short periods. You can add details about hours and minutes spent on different activities
            while working/studying. </p>
        <p>Hence, itâ€™s an excellent resource not just for time entries but also for analyzing where
            does time fly. </p>
